Run AdGuardHome rootless and distroless.

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover all your home devices, and you won't need any client-side software for that.

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will run AdGuard-Home [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md), for maximum security and performance.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small
>* ... this image is provided as a single manifest for amd64, arm64 and **armv7**

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

The default configuration contains no special settings, except ignoring the dnslookup health check in the statistics and as a client to not pollute your UI or statistics. Consider replacing it with your own or start the container with the default one and start changing what you need. The configuration will be updated with your settings if you use the mentioned volumes below. It is recommended to always add the exception for dnslookup.

```yaml
clients:
  persistent:
    - name: dnslookup
      ids:
        - 127.0.0.1
      ignore_querylog: true
      ignore_statistics: true

# DEFAULT SETTINGS üóÉÔ∏è
| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user` | docker | user name |
| `uid` | 1000 | [user identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier) |
| `gid` | 1000 | [group identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_identifier) |
| `home` | /adguard | home directory of user docker |
| `login` | admin // adguard | login using default config |

# ENVIRONMENT üìù
| Parameter | Value | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `DEBUG` | Will activate debug option for container image and app (if available) | |

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [0.107.67](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/adguard/tags?name=0.107.67)
* [0.107.67-unraid](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/adguard/tags?name=0.107.67-unraid)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:0.107.67``` you can use ```:0``` or ```:0.107```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ‚òÅÔ∏è
```
docker pull 11notes/adguard:0.107.67
docker pull ghcr.io/11notes/adguard:0.107.67
docker pull quay.io/11notes/adguard:0.107.67
```

# UNRAID VERSION üü†
This image supports unraid by default. Simply add **-unraid** to any tag and the image will run as 99:100 instead of 1000:1000 causing no issues on unraid. Enjoy.

>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/arch.dockerfile) - contains users, timezones and Root CA certificates, nothing else
>* [11notes/distroless:dnslookup](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/dnslookup.dockerfile) - app to execute DNS lookups

# BUILT WITH üß∞
* [AdGuardHome](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome)

# GENERAL TIPS üìå
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services

# CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
